## Event Handling
The form component design in html can be associated with an event in javascript. An event is an operation by the user which can takes place at any point of time, it should be handled by the JavaScript and depending upon the event a response must be generated. The event can be a mouse click, a key press, a mouse over etc.

- These can be done by specifying the event and the associated function this function will fet executed only when a favorable event takes place. This is implemented in JAVASCRIPT using various techniques one of them is using `addEventListner` to component and associate the event and function.
- A normal function is executed when called by the programmer wereas an event driven programming the calling of function takes place when a related event is performed by the user.
