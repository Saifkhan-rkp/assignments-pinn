Define it in package com.pinnacle.training.evening; The constructor must check hrs, mins and secs are valid or not; if it valid set it directly 


along with the constructor and function to display, the constructor should also change if the date is valid or not it must be in the package
`com.pinnacle.project1` define the class MyTime in a folder testing 1 and the class MyDate in another folder in testing 2 implement the main program testing the class MyDate in a third folder testing3

# Collections

-  Java supports the Collections framework, which is collection of predefined classes and interfaces to represent information in different formats, that is using different data structures. Each Class defines a new method of information storage or retrieval
- All these classes are clubbed in the collections framework so that the set of operation in terms of functions or methods are common across all classes
The basic divisions contain
1. List
2. Set
3. Map
4. Queue
- each of these classes implement a certain interface and each interface extends the Collection Interface hence the collection members are uniformly present in each class
- Its study involves understanding the format of Information storage, understanding the operations on the information and the processing or Iteration of the information
