## Consumer
Java supports the consumer interface which is a part of `java.util.function` package this interfacce consumes a collction of data supports two functions **`accept()`** and **`andThen()`** 
the function **`accept()`** recieves an collection of data and performs the desired operation on the data specified by defining the consumer interface this interface extensively uses the concept of lambda and strings 
**`andThen()`** can be use to perform multiple operations in a perticular sequence this functions can be again use to define a program in a more compact manner
